## Cocktail of the Day

This is a website that generates a new drink every day! The refresh happens at 12 am EST. Currently there are no consistent restrictions or filters as far as what the drink can be, but I am manually moderating most nights to make sure it at least looks ok!

I used this very convenient API ... https://www.thecocktaildb.com/

### Stack
React and JS connecting to a MongoDB Atlas database endpoint. The database is populated by a random cocktail from the cocktaildb once a day via an EC2 server.

### Contributing
I have a few issues that can be taken if you'd like to contribute!
